1. Dynamic Styling Based on State
Create a button that changes its background color when clicked.

Steps:
- Create a button component.
- Use state to manage the button's background color.
- Change the background color dynamically when the button is clicked (you can toggle between two colors).

2.Conditional Styling Based on Props
Create a component that receives a status prop and applies different styles based on the value of the prop.

Steps:
- Create a component that accepts a status prop (e.g., "success", "error", "warning").
- Use inline styles or CSS classes to apply different colors (e.g., green for "success", red for "error") based on the value of the status prop.
- Render different styles depending on the prop passed.
